{/* The content of this doc is shared between the app and pages router. You can use the `<PagesOnly>Content</PagesOnly>` component to add content that is specific to the Pages Router. Any shared content should not be wrapped in a component. */}

Next.js can serve static files, like images, under a folder called `public` in the root directory. Files inside `public` can then be referenced by your code starting from the base URL (`/`).

For example, the file `public/avatars/me.png` can be viewed by visiting the `/avatars/me.png` path. The code to display that image might look like:

```jsx filename="avatar.js"
import Image from 'next/image'

export function Avatar({ id, alt }) {
  return <Image src={`/avatars/${id}.png`} alt={alt} width="64" height="64" />
}

export function AvatarOfMe() {
  return <Avatar id="me" alt="A portrait of me" />
}
```

## Reading files from the filesystem

When you need to read files from the `public` folder, in Route Handlers, Server Components, or Server Functions, avoid using relative paths like `./public/asset.png`. Relative paths can break in production or across platforms because the process working directory may differ from the file location where the code runs.

Instead, resolve paths relative to your project root using `process.cwd()` with `path.join`:

```ts filename="app/api/read-asset/route.ts" switcher
import { readFile } from 'node:fs/promises'
import { join } from 'node:path'

export async function GET() {
  const filePath = join(process.cwd(), 'public', 'asset.png')
  const file = await readFile(filePath)
  return new Response(file, {
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'image/png' },
  })
}
```

```js filename="app/api/read-asset/route.js" switcher
import { readFile } from 'node:fs/promises'
import { join } from 'node:path'

export async function GET() {
  const filePath = join(process.cwd(), 'public', 'asset.png')
  const file = await readFile(filePath)
  return new Response(file, {
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'image/png' },
  })
}
```

The `path.join(process.cwd(), 'public', '...')` pattern, is compatible with most deployment platforms and works the same in development and production.

## Writing to the filesystem at runtime

Avoid writing to the filesystem at runtime to create or modify files in `public` (or elsewhere). In many production environments:

- File writes are not persisted (ephemeral filesystems used to serve requests).
- The platform may block write permissions for security and scalability.
- Next.js build outputs and static asset manifests are generated at build time. Files written at runtime are not included and won’t be served by the static file server.

Prefer storing dynamic data in a database, object storage, or caching layer. If you need to generate assets ahead of time, do so during the build process.

## Caching

Next.js cannot safely cache assets in the `public` folder because they may change. The default caching headers applied are:

```jsx
Cache-Control: public, max-age=0
```

## Robots, Favicons, and others

<PagesOnly>

The folder is also useful for `robots.txt`, `favicon.ico`, Google Site Verification, and any other static files (including `.html`). But make sure to not have a static file with the same name as a file in the `pages/` directory, as this will result in an error. [Read more](/docs/messages/conflicting-public-file-page).

</PagesOnly>

<AppOnly>

For static metadata files, such as `robots.txt`, `favicon.ico`, etc, you should use [special metadata files](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/metadata) inside the `app` folder.

</AppOnly>
