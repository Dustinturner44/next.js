Enable file watch polling for Turbopack and Webpack.

## Usage

The `watchOptions` option allows you to configure a file watching polling interval during development.

```ts filename="next.config.ts" switcher
import type { NextConfig } from 'next'

const nextConfig: NextConfig = {
  watchOptions: {
    pollIntervalMs: 1000,
  },
}

export default nextConfig
```

```js filename="next.config.js" switcher
/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
  watchOptions: {
    pollIntervalMs: 1000,
  },
}

module.exports = nextConfig
```

## Config options

- `pollIntervalMs`: How often to poll for file changes.

Polling is only enabled when the `watchOptions.pollIntervalMs` option is specified.

## When to use

Enable this option if you're running into issues where file changes are not being detected during development.

This can happen when working inside a VM, Docker container, or over a networked volume.

`watchOptions.pollIntervalMs` is passed to both Turbopack and Webpack.
