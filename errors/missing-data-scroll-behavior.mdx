title: 'Missing data-scroll-behavior Attribute for Smooth Scroll'
---

## Why This Warning Occurred

Your application has smooth scrolling enabled via CSS (`scroll-behavior: smooth`), but you haven't added the `data-scroll-behavior="smooth"` attribute to your `<html>` element.

Next.js automatically attempts to detect the smooth scrolling configuration to ensure that navigating back/forward through the router doesn't also trigger the smooth scrolling behavior, as this is often not desired.

## Possible Ways to Fix It

Add `data-scroll-behavior="smooth"` to your `<html>` element if you want to disable smooth scrolling when routing via Next.js.

```html filename="app/layout.tsx"
export default function RootLayout({ children, }: { children: React.ReactNode })
{ return (
<html lang="en" data-scroll-behavior="smooth">
  <body>
    {children}
  </body>
</html>
) }
```

Or if you're using the Pages Router:

```html filename="pages/_document.tsx"
import { Html, Head, Main, NextScript } from 'next/document' export default
function Document() { return (
<html lang="en" data-scroll-behavior="smooth">
  <head />
  <body>
    <main />
    <NextScript />
  </body>
</html>
) }
```

## Why This Optimization Matters

Next.js will only attempt to modify the `scroll-behavior` style on the `<html>` element when the data attribute is present to ensure smooth scrolling isn't triggered. This avoids unnecessary style recalculation unless explicitly opted into.
